/*
 Equatable protocol is used for compare two custom object
  Note -
    1- In case of struct if we confirm equatable protocol no need to confirm it's method but in case of class it's required
    2- If we have not confirmed it's method and try to compare two object internally complier compare all properties. like name and radius both compare.if you want only one property should check then confirm methods.
    3- Equatable is also the base protocol for the Hashable and Comparable protocols
 
  4- In content of struct automatically becomes comparable without the need to implement a custom equation method since all members (UUID and String) are comparable.
